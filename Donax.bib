abstract = {Granting property rights in fisheries is assumed to provide incentives for sustainable resource exploitation. These rights might also open other income options for fishers, including some that go beyond the original objectives intended by authorities establishing the right. The opportunity for alternative uses is especially high if the details of these rights are not clearly identified. In Chile, a de novo TURF (Territorial User Rights for Fishery) system, called Management Exploitation Areas for Benthic Resources ({\'{a}}reas de Manejo y Explotaci{\'{o}}n de Recursos Bent{\'{o}}nicos-AMERB) was created to achieve sustainable exploitation of benthic resources. This study compares two small-scale fishing communities in Chile, Guayac{\'{a}}n and Huentelauqu{\'{e}}n, representing two typical contrasting settings, regarding geographical contexts and surroundings, origin, history, location, social embeddedness, main fisheries activities as well as the motivation and the process through which they acquired their AMERB. While in Guayac{\'{a}}n the main fishing activity outside the AMERB is the giant squid and finfish fishery, in Huentelauqu{\'{e}}n the main and traditional activity has been diving for benthic resources. The objectives to acquire their AMERBs were different in both cases. Huentelauqu{\'{e}}n applied the AMERB for their traditional activity, the fishery of Concholepas concholepas (" loco" ), thus in accordance with the official objective of the AMERB. Due to reduced catches of loco, fishers also added the collection of kelps, using their AMERB to control access to the entire coast surrounding their fishing community, beyond the limits of their AMERB. In Guayac{\'{a}}n the AMERB, applied for the management of scallops and a species of red algae, began to be used for sea squirt aquaculture. Within the framework of sustainable fisheries implied by the AMERBs, there was in both cases a clear expectation to gain new sources of income. However with time both AMERBs are being used as a tool for territorial exclusion of other fishers beyond the limits of their respective AMERBs. In Huentelauqu{\'{e}}n fishers mention mostly negative aspects about the performance of their AMERB, given the poor economic results, being unsatisfied with the AMERB system in general, because they feel that the system disrupted their traditional migration along the coast. In Guayac{\'{a}}n, fishers mentioned mostly positive aspects for their AMERB, as it was an opportunity to add new activities. Both examples show that rights-based management approaches are very attractive; they could promote new uses or developments, whose sustainability nevertheless needs to be analyzed further. The analyzed case studies show that, contrary to how the system was developed in Chile, a more bottom-up implementation of new management arrangements may make it easier to agree on common objectives, and/or leave more freedom for fishers to adjust and arrange their livelihood. Considering the importance the AMERBs have acquired for fishers, these kinds of systems need flexible regulations in order that fishers can adapt the system to local traditions, uses or needs and also to their learning and adapting capacities. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Territorial User Rights for Fisheries (TURF) is considered an appropriate tool for small-scale fishery management. In Chile a TURFs system called Management Exploitation Areas for Benthic Resources ({\'{a}}reas de Manejo y Explotaci{\'{o}}n de Recursos Bent{\'{o}}nicos-AMERB) were developed as a solution for the fishery crisis of Concholepas concholepas, a hard bottom snail. The success of these AMERBs led to its widespread application across different fisheries resources and social-ecological contexts, among them the surf clam Mesodesma donacium which has a highly variable population. Traditionally, fishermen followed the sporadically appearing M. donacium beds, migrating along the coast, a behavior now suppressed under the AMERB regime. We examined the dynamics of the M. donacium fishery, evaluating the performance of the AMERB system for its sustainable exploitation. Fishermen extracted surf clams based on monthly quotas, which were conservative. Despite this, after three years the fishery of M. donacium within the AMERB collapsed because of lack of recruitment and high natural mortality. The resulting low abundances made the fishery unattractive, causing the abandonment of the AMERB. This suggests that implementation of an AMERB system must integrate knowledge of the spatial scales over which different clam beds (subpopulations) are connected. While still ignoring the structure of the metapopulation, as occurs at present for M. donacium stocks in Chile, it could be evaluated to increase capture during the periods of boom, taking advantage of surf clams that will disappear in any case due to natural mortality. A spatial reserve within each clam bed could also be established in order to conserve the unknown but potentially important role of the subpopulation for the metapopulation. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {In order to avoid conflicts when spatially explicit rules are implemented, it is critical to understand the spatial distribution of fishing effort, the migration patterns of fishermen and the use of temporary fishing camps. The migration of fishermen is a process shaped by historical patterns of resource availability, in addition to economic and political factors. We present an example in which a temporary fishing camp used for extraction of benthic resources (Loco: Concholepas concholepas) changed into a permanent one during the study period. Throughout the study period fishing effort (trips) was closely related to the productivity of the different fishing grounds, with more trips directed to the most productive areas. The conversion from a temporary to a permanent fishing camp did not improve the efficiency of the loco fishery, but did allow better access to alternative resources (surf clams) on nearby fishing grounds. The succession from simple shelters to a permanent 'caleta' is a common situation along the Chilean coast, motivated originally by resource availability and more recently by the creation of the TURF system. InÂ particular the TURF system converts temporary (resource driven) movements of fishermen into rigid stationary caletas, which creates a number of problems. Temporary fishing camps are common when fishing grounds are far from the base port, but they require specific administrative tools in order to achieve sustainable fisheries management. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In Chile, a Territorial User Rights for Fisheries system was developed to manage benthic fisheries. This system is referred to as Management Areas for the Exploitation of Benthic Resources. Management areas involved a shift from top-down control by governments to comanagement. We have analyzed the effects of a highly variable fishery, characterized by boom-and-bust cycles, on the governance of local institutions designed for resource management. We focused on a case study in north central Chile, in which the surf clam fishery experienced high levels of variability when the fishery was in an open access system. The management areas were established for the fishery in 1999. As a result, a set of rules for the fishery were created and enforced by fishers and local fishery authorities. Despite intense efforts on the part of all stakeholders, the fishery collapsed after three years of management area policy. This approach has been shown to be an effective management option for other species; however, for resources with boom-and-bust cycles, it is important to understand the response pattern of users confronting this spatial and temporal variability before the establishment of territorial user rights. Defining the appropriate spatial scale of the territorial rights could allow fishers to switch among different surf clam beds to maintain their livelihood and support the sustainability of local institutions for resource management.},

In this area, a total of 223 artisanal boats (68{\%} of the artisanal fleet) are involved in shellfishing targeting bivalve molluscs, including the smooth clam. The artisanal mechanised dredging that targets C. chione in the northern Alboran Sea is described and the current exploitation status of its populations is analysed. A surplus-production model was run using ASPIC and used to assess the temporal variation in the levels of fishing for this bivalve throughout the study period (2002-2015), as well as to suggest conservation reference points that could guarantee the sustainable exploitation of this resource. During the study period, the maximum C. chione catch was registered in 2003 (306 t) and the minimum in 2006 (93 t). The ASPIC model for C. chione stock suggests that a Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) of 216 t could be produced from a total stock biomass of 983 t (Bmsy) at a fishing mortality rate of total biomass of 0.22 (Fmsy), with B/ Bmsy and F/Fmsy values of 1.34 and 0.82, respectively, indicating that the stock is approaching good status.},

abstract = {The precautionary approach calls for both target and limit reference points (TRPs and LRPs, respectively) and notes the vulnerability of developing fisheries to excess effort. LRPs should reflect a population's ability to continue to persist, which depends on lifetime egg production (LEP) and current abundance. The unique characteristics of sea urchin fisheries, such as (i) tight ecological coupling, (ii) their being roe fisheries, (iii) protection of juveniles under adult spine canopies, and (iv) broadcast spawning, can influence their management. Most North American sea urchin fisheries developed rapidly. Their reference points include (i) several LRPs and TRPs based on the logistic or surplus production model, (ii) a unique TRP involving direct monitoring of the bathymetric position of their macrophyte food, and (iii) an LRP based on the fraction of natural, unfished LEP. The dominant effect of fishing down and serial depletion on catch and effort data from developing sea urchin fisheries adversely affects fits to the logistic model. Reference points based on tight ecological coupling will be useful only where food webs are simple and one-dimensional. Sea urchin fisheries developed in the future should consider the fraction of natural LEP as an LRP and attempt to limit early excess fishing capacity.},

Prospecting campaigns were carried out between 2015 and 2017 along the FnideqTamernout area of the occidental Moroccan Mediterranean Sea, through artisanal boats equipped with hydraulic dredges for shellfish fishing. A total of 1526 samples of Callista chione were measured and weighed to estimate and thematically map the density of this species. The population structure, the length-weight relationship and the stock status were studied in total area. Results show that there was a significant difference of size structure distribution of the studied subareas. Mean length of all subareas was 69.15Â±1.13 mm with a minimum of 24.17 mm and a maximum of 105 mm. The large majority of the individuals (93{\%}) sampled presented the exploitable fraction of the stock. Length-weight relationship revealed a negative allometry for all subareas indicating that length grows faster than weight, except that of Amsa with positive allometry. Total biomass of C. chione records 17 million individuals for 1636 tons distributed over 8 subareas of homogeneous concentrations of different densities. Martil and M'diq present the most productive subareas with 78{\%} of total stock. These findings can be used to put rigorous and rational rules for fishing and stock management of this species so as to ensure the preservation of the C. chione resource and the sustainability of the socio-economic activity it generates in the region.},

abstract = {Variation in physical factors is considered the primary organizational force regulating macrobenthic populations and communities of exposed sandy beaches. However, there has been no quantitative evaluation of the intensity of human predation on the macrofauna inhabiting these systems, and information on biological interactions is also lacking. In the present study I review the results of a long-term monitoring study on the yellow clam Mesodesma mactroides (Deshayes, 1854) (Bivalvia: Mesodesmatidae) of an Uruguayan exposed sandy beach, including the effect of a human exclusion experiment as a way to acquire knowledge about its population structure and dynamics. Experimental management was based on the closure of the fishery for 32 months, in which a great part of the artisanal fishery community and the coastal marine authorities were involved in control operations. The experiment was a useful approach to testing the effect of fishing disturbing or altering the yellow clam population: the wide range of fishing effort levels through time allowed the detection of some patterns and processes that until the closure were unknown, namely: (I)the stock recruitment-relationship showed overcompensation, i.e. the inhibition of recruitment at highest adult densities; (2) growth rates of the newly settled cohorts were inversely correlated with the corresponding average adult density: (3) post-settlement natural mortality was highest in the densest cohorts, and was also a function of fishing activity; (4) the amount of fishing effort exerted over Mesodesma mactroides explained variations in abundance of the sympatric population of the wedge clam Donax hanleyanus Philippi, 1845 (Bivalvia: Donacidae). It is concluded that experimental management is a powerful approach to identify factors governing the dynamics of exploited sandy beach populations. to acquire the basic biological knowledge needed to perform adequate management strategies and to quantify the effect of harvesting on other components of the macrofauna. It is also stressed that further research in sandy beach populations should include human activities as important factors affecting long-term trends.},

Observations were made from March 1983 through March 1985 (harvesting season), and additional data from January 1988 to December 1989 (closed season) were also included in the analyses. Parameters of growth and mortality were estimated by methods that make use of age or length information. An age/length relationship was constructed by counting growth rings. Results were consistent with those obtained with modal class progression analysis and other length/frequency methods. The growth curve obtained from the age/length relationship did not account for seasonality in growth rate, and a seasonal growth model explained growth oscillations in a better way. The instantaneous coefficient of natural mortality (M) estimated for the closed season was 1.64, whereas an increase in fishing mortality (F) was observed during 1984. Age composition did not change during the 2 yr of study, and the first 6 mm class accounted for over 50{\%} of the population. The main contribution of recruits was observed between late summer and early fall (February to April), and the recruitment pattern suggested one main settlement period per year. Growth and recruitment success appeared to be regulated by density-dependence processes. Some implications for management are considered in this context. Methodological aspects concerning the reliability of empirical equations and programs for estimating growth and mortality are discussed. {\textcopyright} 1992 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Large-scale changes in American lobster (Homarus americanus) landings and abundance have been documented in both Canada and the United States over the last several decades. The spatial coherence of these changes suggests the importance of common environmental and fishery-related factors operating over broad areas in the western North Atlantic. Changes in both biotic and abiotic factors have been hypothesized to underlie the recent increases in lobster production. Area expansion of lobsters to previously unoccupied or low-density areas appears to be an important element of the population increase. Here, we review biological reference points applied to American lobster populations in the United States and Canada. Egg production per recruit models have been used to specify limit reference points (F10{\%} in the United States) or target reference points (increasing egg production per recruit to twice its 1995 level in Canada). Surplus production and yield-per-recruit models have also been employed to provide qualitative management guidelines. We describe sources of uncertainty in the development of biological reference points for American lobster based on dynamic pool models in relation to the precautionary approach. Finally we consider auxiliary indicators and reference points with potential application to lobster stocks.},

It aims to facilitate the development and implementation of indicators and to serve as a basis for the development of part of the series of Technical Guidelines in Support of the FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries. The paper reviews the concept of sustainable development ('sustainability'). Five sustainability frameworks are suggested for developing and grouping indicators. A discussion of the criteria that could be used to measure and monitor progress towards sustainability includes the types of possible indicators, their use within the sustainability concept, use of reference points on which to compare indicators and their relation to planning and management. Sustainable Development Reference Systems are introduced as a tool for grouping indicators and representing the interrelationships among them. Visual methods of portraying the human and environmental dimensions of sustainability and their indicators can be broadened to permit temporal and spatial comparisons. These, combined with systems to scale the different dimensions to reflect different societal values of their importance, can assist policy makers, fisheries managers, industries, non-governmental organizations and the general public in understanding and assessing progress towards sustainable development of capture fisheries.},

abstract = {The shell growth and reproductive cycle of Donax trunculus (Mollusca: Bivalvia) from southern Portugal were studied from December 1993 to November 1994. Both the acetate peel method and quantification of surface growth rings were used to establish age and estimate growth rate. Widely spaced growth bands were formed in spring and summer whilst narrowly spaced bands were deposited in late summer and early autumn. No cessation of growth was observed during the winter. The von Bertalanffy growth curve estimated from the internal bands did not differ significantly from that obtained from the surface rings. However, the age of clams can be determined more accurately from acetate peels than directly from surface rings. Laboratory experiments demonstrated that periodicity of the deposition of microgrowth bands was related to an innate rhythm. Gonadal development was monitored using standard histological methods. Both males and females showed synchronism in gonadal development. The gametogenic cycle began in late November and ended in late August. Spawning occurred between March and August with two major spawning phases: March and May-August. D. trunculus reached maturity during the first year of life.},

Five collecting areas were sampled in the Ria Formosa barrier islands, namely in the Culatra, Barreta and Armona Islands, between March and June 1998. The study was based on size frequency distribution analysis and shell biometric relationships. The size frequency distribution showed the predominance of smaller individuals ({\textless}25 mm) in the renewal area (0.5-1.0 m depth) and the prevalence of larger individuals (â¥25 mm) at greater depths (4.0-6.0 m depth). The biometric study revealed the existence of significant differences in the type of growth between size classes in relation to depth distribution and burrowing activity. On the basis of these results, some specific management measures were proposed for this important bivalve fishery, taking into account the distinct fishing strategies and operations (manual and boat-operated dredging) performed at different depths.},

abstract = {Spatial fishing closures are typically implemented for conservation and fisheries benefits, but the effects of such initiatives are often not tested. This study examined whether the densities and size compositions of beach clams differed between commercially fished and non-fished zones on beaches. Sampling of clams was stratified across two habitats (swash and dry sand) on two commercially fished beaches, before and during (early and late) the 6-month harvesting period. Two beaches that had no commercial fishing were also sampled the same way and acted as external controls. Differences in densities, but not size compositions, of clams were evident between zones on the commercially fished and control beaches, but they were mostly apparent only across short (day and week) periods before, early and late harvesting, and thus were most likely pulse responses of clams to stochastic, non-fishing related events that acted independently across the different zones on each beach. The potential movements of clams along and across beaches as well as current restrictions on commercial fishing probably dampened detection of longer-term fishing-related impacts and demographic differences in clams between commercially fished and non-fished zones. Direct fishing-related impacts on clams may only be discernable in the immediate vicinity of, and persist for a short period following, an actual fishing event on a beach. Nevertheless, the zones closed to commercial fishing may provide valuable protection to a portion of clams on each beach and alleviate beach-wide harvesting impacts. The broader value of these closed fishing zones requires knowledge of the impacts of fishing on other beach organisms and ecosystem functioning. Further experimentation that tests other aspects of management arrangements of beach clams may help determine their global applicability for sustainable harvesting, and contribute to the overall conservation management of sandy beach ecosystems.},

FiSAT software (FAO-ICLARM Stock Assessment Tools) was used for calculating population parameters of this species. The specimens of D. trunculus (Linnaeus, 1758) were collected monthly in the Agadir Marine Bay (South of Morocco) for two years (January 2016âDecember 2017) from three stations (S1, S2 and S3), which are directly exposed to eventual pollutants owing to the developing tourism resort Taghazout Bay. The study of the population dynamics of D. trunculus shows that the annual mean of density, biomass and condition index, presents significant seasonal variations depending on the physico-chemical parameters and the animal's life cycle. The monitoring of age-class frequency distributions of D. trunculus individuals revealed a slighter difference at the three study stations. Asymptotic length (Lâ) was 37.96 mm and growth coefficient (K) was estimated at 1.93 year â1. Total mortality (Z) for D. trunculus was 3.30 year â1. Natural mortality (M) and fishing mortality (F) were 1.73 yearâ1 and 1.57 year â1 respectively. Exploitation level (E) was computed as 0.48, indicating an optimum level of exploitation of D. trunculus in the coastal waters of Taghazout. It is well demonstrated that bimodal recruitment takes place twice a year; one in late summerâearly autumn and the other in spring. The results of this study provide information on the health status of this ecosystem receiving Taghazout Bay project.},

The stock assessment was supported on an integrated catch-at-size assessment model. The model described the population changes, including recruitment, selectivity, fishing mortality, individual growth patterns and survival over time, providing management quantities for the geoduck clam fishery, such as biomass-at-length (total and vulnerable) and harvest rate-at-length. The results indicated overfishing of the geoduck clam population; the harvest rate exceeded the management tactics established for this fishery, even the individuals smaller than the minimum legal size (130 mm) were harvested. Thus, declines in the total biomass (from 3,262 to 1,130 t) and recruitment (representing an 86{\%} decrease) were observed from 2010 to 2012. Although the results showed a recovery trend in recruitment and total biomass from 2014 to 2016, this trend may have been due to the spatial relocation of fishing mortality.},

abstract = {In this paper, we concentrate on spatial aspects of growth and reproduction for sea scallops (Placopecten magellanicus) to advance the general theory for development of reference points for sessile animals and to illustrate the general points with several specific examples. Nonlinear mixed effects models can be used to define the spatial distribution of growth rates and their implications for the definition of growth overfishing. We develop a basin model to illustrate that the typical "boom and bust" effects, often attributed to environmental factors, are explained equally well by spatial variations in habitat quality, spatial concentration of fisheries, and dispersal of larvae among areas. Results suggest that incentives to concentrate fishing effort in lower productivity areas may be an effective tool for reducing recruitment variation and improving yields. Reductions in fishing mortality might be possible with closed areas as they can be used to reduce the concentration of effort on high scallop densities. Further, rotational area management strategies can offer the promise of balancing demands for increased yield, prevention of recruitment overfishing, maintaining spawning reserves, and reducing habitat damage and bycatch.},

A workshop on reference points for invertebrate fisheries was held in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, from 2 to 5 December 2002 to address the particular needs of fisheries on this diverse group of species. Seven of the papers presented at that workshop were published as a group in this issue of the Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Science. Reproduction and recruitment were identified by all of these papers as key elements of population resilience and productivity that needed to be monitored in some way. The monitoring of reproductive capacity should be extended to aspects important in the mating systems, such as local densities, spatial patterns of age-size structure, and spatial and temporal patterns of breeding areas for broadcast spawners with poorly mobile or sessile adults. Similarly, such monitoring would also include female and male size and the number of female reproductive opportunities for crustacean species with copulating adults.},

abstract = {This study was the first attempt to characterize the recreational harvesting of the wedge clam (Donax trunculus). For this purpose, 403 face-to-face interviews were performed in the summers of 2018 and 2019 in southern Portugal. The majority of the harvesters frequented the selected beaches during holidays and collected wedge clams as a hobby for an appetizer. The respondents reported an inter-annual variation in their catches of wedge clam with a decreasing abundance in 2018 followed by a recovery in 2019, but with more recreational harvesters collecting undersized individuals. Although most harvesters declared to consume D. trunculus, only a few bought wedge clams being the clams' size a secondary factor in their valorization. The majority of the recreational harvesters did not know the species' minimum conservation reference size nor the legally allowed maximum daily catch. It was estimated that recreational harvesters can collect 13 tonnes of wedge clams during the summer season along the southeastern coast of Algarve. Even though manual harvesting is not an efficient fishing technique, the lack of selectivity of harvesters can eventually compromise the resilience of D. trunculus populations. Despite most respondents affirmed to get informed about marine biotoxins, most surveys were done during periods of interdiction for shellfish harvesting. The present results revealed that the population is still unaware of the health risks of consuming shellfish contaminated with biotoxins. Educational activities and awareness campaigns are required to further inform recreational harvesters about the regulations in force for this activity and the sanitary threats of marine biotoxins.},

abstract = {This study aimed to augment existing knowledge of the reproductive characteristics of Donax trunculus through analysis of timing variations and the influence of shell size on partial fecundity (PF) during the reproductive period. To achieve this objective, two reproductive timing characteristics were also studied: size at first maturity (SL50) and the reproductive cycle using histology and image analysis techniques. SL50 was 10.83 mm for females and 10.86 for males. Donax trunculus showed a continuous and simultaneous release of gametes and high oocyte regeneration ability during the reproductive period (from February to July). These reproductive characteristics impeded the estimation of total fecundity. However, throughout the reproductive period an increasing pattern of PF was observed followed by a significant drop at the end of the same period, which could be quantified (293,390 of vitellogenic and ripe oocytes). At the same time PF quantifications allowed for predicting and estimating the influence of shell length (SL) on the reproductive output as a function of oocyte typology (PF = 4.12 + 3.96 SL; r 2 = 0.86; all types). Levels of prevalence of a digenetic trematode-like parasite with castrate ability fluctuated between 0-20{\%} depending on the time of the year and sex. In addition, the possible consequences of two different scenarios of population size structure on the reproductive output were simulated, and highlighted how beach areas supporting high levels of anthropogenic pressure (Isla Canela) could compromise future recruitments, producing 84{\%} less oocytes than a beach with a lower level of disturbance (Do{\~{n}}ana).},

abstract = {The main objectives of this study were (i) to provide an updated age-length key for D. trunculus from Atlantic waters, and (ii) to evaluate population dynamics, the timing of recruitment and production parameters of the wedge clam Donax trunculus in two moderately exposed sandy beaches (the protected area of Do{\~{n}}ana National Park and the tourist destination of Isla Canela) along the littoral of Huelva (SW Spain). First an in-depth analysis of the shell and updated estimation of growth parameters of the intertidal D. trunculus population were performed between January 2014 and July 2015 using two different methods i) thin-layer cross section (TL) (ii) length-frequency distributions (LFD). Von Bertalanffy growth functions provided an asymptotic length of 46Â mm (LFD) and 46.7Â mm (TL) and growth constants of 0.48 (LFD) and 0.47Â yrâ1 (TL) in Do{\~{n}}ana beach. In addition, several deformities as well as signs of shell repair were observed. Population dynamics analyses through length-frequency distribution clarified the timing of recruitment (FebruaryâMarch and July). The mean annual biomass (BÂ¯) of intertidal populations of D. trunculus ranged between 3.03 (Do{\~{n}}ana) and 3.31Â g ash-free dry mass (AFDW) mâ2Â yrâ1 (Isla Canela). Individual production showed the highest value at 27Â mm length (0.117Â gÂ AFDWÂ mâ2Â yrâ1) and annual production (P) ranged between 3.40 (Do{\~{n}}ana) and 4.91Â g (Isla Canela), resulting in renewal rate (P/BÂ¯) values between 1.03 and 1.61, respectively. The present results, together with information on environmental parameters, revealed clear differences in population dynamics and production between beaches related to the presence or absence of a protection figure.},

abstract = {In a resource management perspective, the understanding of the relative influence of the physical factors on species connectivity remains a major challenge and is also of great ecological and conservation biology interest. Despite the overfishing threat on the wedge clam Donax trunculus in Europe, relatively little information is known about its population genetic structure and connectivity and their consequences on conservation policies. We employed 16 microsatellite loci to characterise the genetic diversity and population structure of D. trunculus. A total of 514 samples from seven different localities along the Atlantic-Mediterranean transition, from the Atlantic (Gulf of C{\'{a}}diz) to the north-western Mediterranean were genotyped. The analysis of the population genetic structure displayed a clear distinction along the Atlantic-Mediterranean transition with different clusters in the Atlantic Ocean, the Alboran Sea and the northwestern Mediterranean. Consequently, we recommend that these three areas should be considered as different management units. We showed that all populations seem to be at high long-term risk of extinction with the exception of the protected Do{\~{n}}ana National Park population which still seems to have evolutionary potential. Therefore, our results emphasized the necessity of protection of this economic resource and the validity of molecular tools to evaluate the population dynamics.},

The spawning period is essentially synchronic, and extends from February to August, with different individual intensity. Three peaks of spawning have been recorded, April, June and July. The resting period ranges from September to December, with the whole population in cytolized stage in October. The favourable environmental variables, such as high levels of chlorophyll a and relatively mild seawater temperatures allow this extensive reproductive period.

abstract = {Stock synthesis (SS) is a statistical age-structured population modeling framework that has been applied in a wide variety of fish assessments globally. The framework is highly scalable from data-weak situations where it operates as an age-structured production model, to complex situations where it can flexibly incorporate multiple data sources and account for biological and environmental processes. SS implements compensatory population dynamics through use of a function relating mean recruitment to spawner reproductive output. This function enhances the ability of SS to operate in data-weak situations and enables it to estimate fishery management quantities such as fishing rates that would provide for maximum sustainable yield and to employ these rates in forecasts of potential yield and future stock status. Complex model configurations such as multiple areas and multiple growth morphs are possible, tag-recapture data can be used to aid estimation of movement rates among areas, and most parameters can change over time in response to environmental and ecosystem factors. SS is coded using Auto-Differentiation Model Builder, so inherits its powerful capability to efficiently estimate hundreds of parameters using either maximum likelihood or Bayesian inference. Output processing, principally through a package developed in R, enables rapid model diagnosis. Details of the underlying population dynamics and the statistical framework used within SS are provided. {\textcopyright} 2012.},

abstract = {Many criteria for statistical parameter estimation, such as maximum likelihood, are formulated as a nonlinear optimization problem. Automatic Differentiation Model Builder (ADMB) is a programming framework based on automatic differentiation, aimed at highly nonlinear models with a large number of parameters. The benefits of using AD are computational efficiency and high numerical accuracy, both crucial in many practical problems. We describe the basic components and the underlying philosophy of ADMB, with an emphasis on functionality found in no other statistical software. One example of such a feature is the generic implementation of Laplace approximation of high-dimensional integrals for use in latent variable models. We also review the literature in which ADMB has been used, and discuss future development of ADMB as an open source project. Overall, the main advantages of ADMB are flexibility, speed, precision, stability and built-in methods to quantify uncertainty. {\textcopyright} 2012 Taylor {\&} Francis.},

In this work, we develop the use of quantification methods for IUU fishing in data-poor fisheries and provide estimates for the main shellfish species exploited in S-fisheries in Galicia (NW Spain). To make the estimates, we use a model whose primary input is the Confiscations per unit of policing effort (CPUPE) index, which relates the sanctions imposed for poaching, estimated poaching, and confiscations carried out by the Enforcement Forces. The estimates for the period 2012â2020 are 660.2 t of illegal catches of different species and an average number of 1,766.2 poachers/year. These estimates provide evidence that makes it possible to analyse tendencies in illegal fishing, to establish assessment baselines and to highlight potential improvements in the fight against IUU fishing in small-scale fisheries.},
